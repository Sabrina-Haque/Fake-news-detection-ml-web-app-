They encouraged others on a radio show Tuesday night to  turn the tide  and kill white people and cops to send a message about the killing of black people in America.One of the F***YoFlag organizers is called  Sunshine.  She has a radio blog show hosted from Texas called    Sunshine s F***ing Opinion Radio Show. A snapshot of her #FYF911 @LOLatWhiteFear Twitter page at 9:53 p.m. shows that she was urging supporters to  Call now!! #fyf911 tonight we continue to dismantle the illusion of white Below is a SNAPSHOT Twitter Radio Call Invite   #FYF911The radio show aired at 10:00 p.m. eastern standard time.During the show   callers clearly call for  lynching  and  killing  of white people.A 2:39 minute clip from the radio show can be heard here. It was provided to Breitbart Texas by someone who would like to be referred to as  Hannibal.  He has already received death threats as a result of interrupting #FYF911 conference calls.An unidentified black man said  when those mother f**kers are by themselves   that s when when we should start f***ing them up. Like they do us                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                when a bunch of them ni**ers takin  one of us out                                                                                                                                            that s how we should roll up.

Let s turn the tables. They conspired that if  cops started losing people                                                                                                                                                                                            then  there will be a state of emergency. He speculated that one of two things would happen    a big-ass [R s?????] war                                                                                                  or  ni**ers                                                                                                                                                                      they are going to start backin  up. We are already getting killed out here so what the f**k we got to lose? Sunshine could be heard saying    Yep                                                                                           that s true. That s so f**king true. He said                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 We need to turn the tables on them. Our kids are getting shot out here. Somebody needs to become a sacrifice on their side.He said                                                                                       Everybody ain t down for that s**t                                                                                                                                                              or whatever                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    but like I say                                                                           everybody has a different position of war.  He continued              Because they don t give a f**k anyway.  He said again                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    We might as well utilized them for that s**t and turn the tables on these n**ers. He said                                    that way  we can start lookin  like we ain t havin  that many casualties   and there can be more causalities on their side instead of ours. They are out their killing black people   black lives don t matter                                                                                                                                                                                    that s what those mother f**kers   so we got to make it matter to them. Find a mother f**ker that is alone. Snap his ass                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   and then f***in hang him from a damn tree. Take a picture of it and then send it to the mother f**kers. We  just need one example    and  then people will start watchin .  This will turn the tables on s**t                                                                                    he said. He said this will start  a trickle-down effect.  He said that when one white person is hung and then they are just  flat-hanging                   that will start the  trickle-down effect.  He continued                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Black people are good at starting trends. He said that was how  to get the upper-hand. Another black man spoke up saying they needed to kill  cops that are killing us. The first black male said    That will be the best method right there. Breitbart Texas previously reported how Sunshine was upset when  racist white people  infiltrated and disrupted one of her conference calls.

The U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Columbia had previously issued a broader search warrant in July to DreamHost                                                                                                                                    a Los Angeles-based web hosting company                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            to obtain data about visitors to website disruptj20.org. Disruptj20 is home to a coalition of political activists who organized disruptive protests during President Donald Trump’s inauguration.  The Justice Department said it sought the records connected to the site amid concerns that it helped facilitate the planning of violent riots on Inauguration Day in which more than 200 people were arrested for rioting and vandalizing businesses in downtown Washington. DreamHost resisted the request   saying the scope of the warrant was too broad and trampled on the rights of 1.3 million visitors to the site                                                                                 many of whom were simply exercising their First Amendment rights to express their political views. The Justice Department on Tuesday proposed amending the scope of its warrant in a filing with the Superior Court of the District of Columbia Criminal Division   which is slated to hold a hearing over the dispute on Thursday morning. “The warrant - like the criminal investigation - is singularly focused on criminal activity. It will not be used for any other purpose  ” it wrote.  “The government has no interest in records relating to the 1.3 million IP addresses that are mentioned in DreamHost’s numerous press releases and opposition brief.” The department proposed asking the court to amend the warrant   and said that DreamHost “should not disclose the contents of unpublished draft publications” or “HTTP request and error logs.” An attorney for DreamHost called the Justice Department’s action “a tremendous win for DreamHost                                                               its users and the public.” But in a statement                                                  DreamHost counsel Raymond Aghaian added: “There remains                                                                   unfortunately                                                                                                                                                                     other privacy and First and Fourth Amendment issues with the search warrant                                                                  which we will address in a separate filing and at the hearing Thursday morning.”\"             0

China recruits senior military officials and conducts cyber attacks against the United States. What is worse                                                                                                                                                                                     the Chinese intelligence has stolen Pentagon's plans for the future conflict with China                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          a recent report to US Congress said. The annual report from the US-China Economic and Security Review Commission has sounded the alarm with regard to the activities of Chinese security forces. The report said that despite extensive ties between Beijing and Washington                                                                                                                        the US-China relations have remained tense during the current year                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               the Washington Free Beacon said. The relations between China and the United States have worsened primarily because of China's territorial claims in the South China Sea                      permission from the United States to sell weapons to Taiwan                                                                                                                                                                                                         the deployment of the missile defense system in South Korea                                                                                                                                                      Chinese cyber attacks and the US-led policy to \"\"restore balance\"\" in Asia.As for most serious threats                                                                                                                                           the report highlights cybercrime and the \"\"involvement of the human factor\"\" to gain access to objects of national security. The activities of the Chinese intelligence have increased significantly over the past 15 years. The work is carried out through the Ministry of State Security   the People's Liberation Army of China and military departments of the Communist Party          the report said. As for the \"\"human factor\"\"                                                                              the report refers to the story of the recruitment of US Pacific Command Lieutenant Colonel Benjamin Pierce Bishop. The man was in an intimate relationship with a Chinese woman   who eventually recruited him. Thus                                                                                                           the information about US military secrets in the field of nuclear weapons                      secrets of the Reaper MQ-9 UAV and the secret US report about the Strategy of the Ministry of Defense of China was compromised. The report also mentions a few other recruited gentlemen: another senior official of the Pacific Command - James Fondren                                    who delivered \"\"The National Defense Strategy of the USA\"\" to China in 2010. Another man                                                                                                                                 Greg Bergerssen                                                                                                                                                                                  delivered state secrets to China before he was arrested in 2008. US naval officer Edward Lin was caught for selling secrets of the US Navy to China. All this information may undermine the military superiority of the United States by promoting China's military modernization and providing China with understanding of the tactics of military operations and other operational approaches of the United States to potential developments in the region   the report said. Noteworthy                                                              China spies even on members of government delegations. For example   British officials                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        before going to the G20 summit in Hangzhou                                                                                    were instructed to avoid contacts with \"\"Chinese spies who offer sex\"\"     The Irish Times said. The officials were instructed not to take any gifts                                  especially electronic devices containing memory cards                                                                                                                                                       SIM-cards or chargers as they could serve as a basis for video and audio surveillance. All the members of the British delegation were given temporary mobile phones and e-mail addresses. The officials were even recommended to change their clothes under blankets to avoid any chance of taking their nude pictures. \"\"Chinese intelligence has repeatedly infiltrated U.S. national security entities and extracted information with serious consequences for U.S. national security   including information on the plans and operations of U.S. military forces and the designs of U.S. weapons and weapons systems      \"\" the report said. \"\"Among the information extracted were 5.6 million fingerprints                                                                           some of which could be used to identify undercover U.S. government agents or to create duplicates of biometric data to obtain access to classified areas  \"\" it continued. China uses a variety of \"\"actors\"\" for its cyber espionage - from \"\"government contractor\"\" to independent \"\"patriotic hackers\"\" and \"\"criminal entities.\"\" These groups often interact with each other. The US Department of Justice paid attention to the arrest of US citizen Allen Ho   who was accused of stealing nuclear technology for China General Group. Ho enlisted as many as six American engineers for the purpose. In addition                                                   the DoJ and the FBI accused Chinese nationals of the theft of know-how technology for the production of carbon fiber for submarines and compounds for bleaching materials.The FBI evaluated losses from industrial espionage at 19 billion dollars a year. In one outstanding incidence                                                                                                                                                                former Secretary of Commerce Carlos Gutierrez had his laptop hacked into and copied in Beijing   even though Gutierrez was one of the key figures in international trade negotiations. The information from his laptop was subsequently used to break into US government computers.James Andrew Lewis of the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington said that the stolen intellectual property of the USA brings China the profit of up to 100 billion a year. Interestingly   only a few Chinese spies have been arrested so far                                         John R. Schindler wrote for The Observer. The potential of the Chinese intelligence is high: 300                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         000 Chinese students studying in American universities.

[After swearing in Xavier Becerra as the new California Attorney General                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        to replace the seat vacated by   Senator Kamala Harris ( ) Governor Brown launched into what sounded much more like an opening bid for a presidential campaign against Donald Trump                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              rather than the bitterly   tirade most expected after reading the title of his speech: “California is Not Turning Back                                                                       Not Now                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Not Ever. ”  Even though the word “Trump” was not in the speech                                                                                                                                                  Brown’s focus was unmistakeable.  Instead of addressing the real state of the state  —   the faltering economy in what has become one of the most unfriendly states to business owners  —   Brown bragged about how great California is          and threw down the gauntlet to Washington                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     D. C. He waxed poetic about how California is still the sixth largest economy in the world     and tied the future of the nation to California’s destiny: “When California does well                                     America does well  …    when California hurts                                                                                                                                     America hurts. ” The   governor was surprisingly animated                                                                                    upbeat and optimistic. Describing California as the “beacon of hope to the rest of the world  ” his short speech revisited what he described as California’s successes of his past terms in office: All these items were received in the   chamber with raucous cheers and loud applause that seemed more appropriate at a campaign rally than the august Assembly chamber. At one point   Brown went uncharacteristically off script and again sounded like he wished he were president when claiming he would fight to defend for “Planned Parenthood” funding. It is unclear how he plans to keep that promise   as leader of the state likely to have the least influence in the Trump administration. Gov. Brown went to great lengths to highlight and praise the role of immigrants in California’s success   erasing the line between legal and illegal immigrant. When it came to the epic battle so many California Democrats have picked with President Trump                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Brown’s approach was more intellectual. He discussed how his family came to California   mentioned his father being governor 60 years ago                     and  ending that reverie with an exhortation to fight the federal government with a “spirit that will get us through the difficulties ahead. ” California’s   governor reserved his toughest words for the “new oresident” over climate change. Brown acknowledged the “deep divisions  ” stating that “alternative facts” and “attacks on science” were deeply disturbing.   He warned that democracy is a   system   and that in the massive protests over the weekend                          we “witnessed vast                                                                                         inspiring fervor” that represented the true heart of the people. In one moment that was classic Brown  —   and perhaps why he earned the name “Moonbeam”  —   he praised Trump for wanting to build roads   bridges and railroads (with a chuckle over the   rail debacle) and said in a whimsical way                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 sounding more like a hippie than governor of the largest state: “Amen to that                                                       brother!” And that wasn’t the only area where Brown sought to be seen as a leader of more than just his own party. At one point near the end of the speech   he called out his more vitriolic colleagues to accept “reality” and work to be more respectful of “Republicans”  —   who really are people                 too. But that’s not likely to distract many Californians from the stark reality of what was once their California dream. Brown inadvertently revealed the true state of the state  —     overtaxed                                                                                                          and over committed to the point it cannot even repair the state highways or pay out pensions owed without levying yet another tax. Surprisingly                                                      Brown acknowledged federal supremacy in the area of immigration                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        but then highlighted how California has staked out protections for “undocumented Californians   ” reiterating his commitment to defy any enforcement of federal law that threatens illegal aliens in the state. Bragging that California had become a sanctuary state under the Trust Act  —   which allows no criminal aliens to be turned over to federal authorities for deportation  —   and granted drivers licenses for illegal aliens                                                         as well as giving them   free college tuition                                              Brown made it clear he will defend the state he described as the “Great Exception. ” By acknowledging that Covered California (the state’s version of ObamaCare) requires tens of billions in funding from the federal government                                                                                                                                                                         Gov. Brown gave President Trump an opening  —   and revealed the Golden State’s Achilles heel.  By repealing ObamaCare                                                                                                                                                            and ending this massive subsidy   California’s budget will fail. California may be an exceptional state in many ways   but it will not be the “great exception” when it comes to basic budget math. To borrow the governor’s own words   you can’t make 2 times 2 equal anything but 4  —   not even in California. No wonder so many Americans are fleeing California for an “alternative reality”  —   one without Governor Jerry “Moonbeam” Brown. Tim Donnelly is a former California State Assemblyman.

He said                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Cause we already roll up in gangs anyway. There should be six or seven black mother f**ckers                                                                                                                    see that white person                                                                                                                                                                                                                            and then lynch their ass. Let s turn the tables. They conspired that if  cops started losing people                                                                                                                                                                                            then  there will be a state of emergency. He speculated that one of two things would happen    a big-ass [R s?????] war                                                                                                  or  ni**ers                                                                                                                                                                      they are going to start backin  up. We are already getting killed out here so what the f**k we got to lose? Sunshine could be heard saying    Yep                                                                                           that s true. That s so f**king true. He said                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 We need to turn the tables on them. Our kids are getting shot out here. Somebody needs to become a sacrifice on their side.He said                                                                                       Everybody ain t down for that s**t                                                                                                                                                              or whatever                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    but like I say                                                                           everybody has a different position of war.  He continued              Because they don t give a f**k anyway.  He said again                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    We might as well utilized them for that s**t and turn the tables on these n**ers. He said                                    that way  we can start lookin  like we ain t havin  that many casualties   and there can be more causalities on their side instead of ours. They are out their killing black people   black lives don t matter                                                                                                                                                                                    that s what those mother f**kers   so we got to make it matter to them. Find a mother f**ker that is alone. Snap his ass                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   and then f***in hang him from a damn tree. Take a picture of it and then send it to the mother f**kers. We  just need one example    and  then people will start watchin .  This will turn the tables on s**t                                                                                    he said. He said this will start  a trickle-down effect.  He said that when one white person is hung and then they are just  flat-hanging                   that will start the  trickle-down effect.  He continued                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Black people are good at starting trends. He said that was how  to get the upper-hand. Another black man spoke up saying they needed to kill  cops that are killing us. The first black male said    That will be the best method right there. Breitbart Texas previously reported how Sunshine was upset when  racist white people  infiltrated and disrupted one of her conference calls. She subsequently released the phone number of one of the infiltrators. The veteran immediately started receiving threatening calls.One of the #F***YoFlag movement supporters allegedly told a veteran who infiltrated their publicly posted conference call    We are going to rape and gut your pregnant wife                                                 and your f***ing piece of sh*t unborn creature will be hung from a tree. Breitbart Texas previously encountered Sunshine at a Sandra Bland protest at the Waller County Jail in Texas                                                                                                                                                                                                               where she said all white people should be killed. She told journalists and photographers    You see this nappy-ass hair on my head?   That means I am one of those more militant Negroes.  She said she was at the protest because  these redneck mother-f**kers murdered Sandra Bland because she had nappy hair like me. #FYF911 black radicals say they will be holding the  imperial powers  that are actually responsible for the terrorist attacks on September 11th accountable on that day   as reported by Breitbart Texas. There are several websites and Twitter handles for the movement. Palmetto Star  describes himself as one of the head organizers. He said in a YouTube video that supporters will be burning their symbols of  the illusion of their superiority    their  false white supremacy      like the American flag                                                              the British flag                                                                                                  police uniforms                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              and Ku Klux Klan hoods.Sierra McGrone or  Nocturnus Libertus  posted    you too can help a young Afrikan clean their a** with the rag of oppression.

The U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Columbia had previously issued a broader search warrant in July to DreamHost                                                                                                                                    a Los Angeles-based web hosting company                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            to obtain data about visitors to website disruptj20.org. Disruptj20 is home to a coalition of political activists who organized disruptive protests during President Donald Trump’s inauguration.  The Justice Department said it sought the records connected to the site amid concerns that it helped facilitate the planning of violent riots on Inauguration Day in which more than 200 people were arrested for rioting and vandalizing businesses in downtown Washington. DreamHost resisted the request   saying the scope of the warrant was too broad and trampled on the rights of 1.3 million visitors to the site                                                                                 many of whom were simply exercising their First Amendment rights to express their political views. The Justice Department on Tuesday proposed amending the scope of its warrant in a filing with the Superior Court of the District of Columbia Criminal Division   which is slated to hold a hearing over the dispute on Thursday morning. “The warrant - like the criminal investigation - is singularly focused on criminal activity. It will not be used for any other purpose  ” it wrote.  “The government has no interest in records relating to the 1.3 million IP addresses that are mentioned in DreamHost’s numerous press releases and opposition brief.” The department proposed asking the court to amend the warrant   and said that DreamHost “should not disclose the contents of unpublished draft publications” or “HTTP request and

The relations between China and the United States have worsened primarily because of China's territorial claims in the South China Sea                      permission from the United States to sell weapons to Taiwan                                                                                                                                                                                                         the deployment of the missile defense system in South Korea                                                                                                                                                      Chinese cyber attacks and the US-led policy to \"\"restore balance\"\" in Asia.As for most serious threats                                                                                                                                           the report highlights cybercrime and the \"\"involvement of the human factor\"\" to gain access to objects of national security. The activities of the Chinese intelligence have increased significantly over the past 15 years. The work is carried out through the Ministry of State Security   the People's Liberation Army of China and military departments of the Communist Party          the report said. As for the \"\"human factor\"\"                                                                              the report refers to the story of the recruitment of US Pacific Command Lieutenant Colonel Benjamin Pierce Bishop. The man was in an intimate relationship with a Chinese woman   who eventually recruited him. Thus                                                                                                           the information about US military secrets in the field of nuclear weapons                      secrets of the Reaper MQ-9 UAV and the secret US report about the Strategy of the Ministry of Defense of China was compromised. The report also mentions a few other recruited gentlemen: another senior official of the Pacific Command - James Fondren                                    who delivered \"\"The National Defense Strategy of the USA\"\" to China in 2010. Another man                                                                                                                                 Greg Bergerssen                                                                                                                                                                                  delivered state secrets to China before he was arrested in 2008. US naval officer Edward Lin was caught for selling secrets of the US Navy to China. All this information may undermine the military superiority of the United States by promoting China's military modernization and providing China with understanding of the tactics of military operations and other operational approaches of the United States to potential developments in the region   the report said. Noteworthy                                                              China spies even on members of government delegations. For example   British officials                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        before going to the G20 summit in Hangzhou                                                                                    were instructed to avoid contacts with \"\"Chinese spies who offer sex\"\"     The Irish Times said. The officials were instructed not to take any gifts                                  especially electronic devices containing memory cards                                                                                                                                                       SIM-cards or chargers as they could serve as a basis for video and audio surveillance. All the members of the British delegation were given temporary mobile phones and e-mail addresses. The officials were even recommended to change their clothes under blankets to avoid any chance of taking their nude pictures. \"\"Chinese intelligence has repeatedly infiltrated U.S. national security entities and extracted information with serious consequences for U.S. national security   including information on the plans and operations of U.S. military forces and the designs of U.S. weapons and weapons systems      \"\" the report said. \"\"Among the information extracted were 5.6 million fingerprints                                                                           some of which could be used to identify undercover U.S. government agents or to create duplicates of biometric data to obtain access to classified areas  \"\" it continued. China uses a variety of \"\"actors\"\" for its cyber espionage - from \"\"government contractor\"\" to independent \"\"patriotic hackers\"\" and \"\"criminal entities.\"\" These groups often interact with each other. The US Department of Justice paid attention to the arrest of US citizen Allen Ho   who was accused of stealing nuclear technology for China General Group. Ho enlisted as many as six American engineers for the purpose. In addition                                                   the DoJ and the FBI accused Chinese nationals of the theft of know-how technology for the production of carbon fiber for submarines and compounds for bleaching materials.The FBI evaluated losses from industrial espionage at 19 billion dollars a year. In one outstanding incidence                                                                                                                                                                former Secretary of Commerce Carlos Gutierrez had his laptop hacked into and copied in Beijing   even though Gutierrez was one of the key figures in international trade negotiations. The information from his laptop was subsequently used to break into US government computers.James Andrew Lewis of the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington said that the stolen intellectual property of the USA brings China the profit of up to 100 billion a year. Interestingly   only a few Chinese spies have been arrested so far                                         John R. Schindler wrote for The Observer. The potential of the Chinese intelligence is high: 300                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         000 Chinese students studying in American universities.

He waxed poetic about how California is still the sixth largest economy in the world     and tied the future of the nation to California’s destiny: “When California does well                                     America does well  …    when California hurts                                                                                                                                     America hurts. ” The   governor was surprisingly animated                                                                                    upbeat and optimistic. Describing California as the “beacon of hope to the rest of the world  ” his short speech revisited what he described as California’s successes of his past terms in office: All these items were received in the   chamber with raucous cheers and loud applause that seemed more appropriate at a campaign rally than the august Assembly chamber. At one point   Brown went uncharacteristically off script and again sounded like he wished he were president when claiming he would fight to defend for “Planned Parenthood” funding. It is unclear how he plans to keep that promise   as leader of the state likely to have the least influence in the Trump administration. Gov. Brown went to great lengths to highlight and praise the role of immigrants in California’s success   erasing the line between legal and illegal immigrant. When it came to the epic battle so many California Democrats have picked with President Trump                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Brown’s approach was more intellectual. He discussed how his family came to California   mentioned his father being governor 60 years ago                     and  ending that reverie with an exhortation to fight the federal government with a “spirit that will get us through the difficulties ahead. ” California’s   governor reserved his toughest words for the “new oresident” over climate change. Brown acknowledged the “deep divisions  ” stating that “alternative facts” and “attacks on science” were deeply disturbing.   He warned that democracy is a   system   and that in the massive protests over the weekend                          we “witnessed vast                                                                                         inspiring fervor” that represented the true heart of the people. In one moment that was classic Brown  —   and perhaps why he earned the name “Moonbeam”  —   he praised Trump for wanting to build roads   bridges and railroads (with a chuckle over the   rail debacle) and said in a whimsical way                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 sounding more like a hippie than governor of the largest state: “Amen to that                                                       brother!” And that wasn’t the only area where Brown sought to be seen as a leader of more than just his own party. At one point near the end of the speech   he called out his more vitriolic colleagues to accept “reality” and work to be more respectful of “Republicans”  —   who really are people                 too. But that’s not likely to distract many Californians from the stark reality of what was once their California dream. Brown inadvertently revealed the true state of the state  —     overtaxed                                                                                                          and over committed to the point it cannot even repair the state highways or pay out pensions owed without levying yet another tax. Surprisingly                                                      Brown acknowledged federal supremacy in the area of immigration                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        but then highlighted how California has staked out protections for “undocumented Californians   ” reiterating his commitment to defy any enforcement of federal law that threatens illegal aliens in the state. Bragging that California had become a sanctuary state under the Trust Act  —   which allows no criminal aliens to be turned over to federal authorities for deportation  —   and granted drivers licenses for illegal aliens                                                         as well as giving them   free college tuition                                              Brown made it clear he will defend the state he described as the “Great Exception. ” By acknowledging that Covered California (the state’s version of ObamaCare) requires tens of billions in funding from the federal government                                                                                                                                                                         Gov. Brown gave President Trump an opening  —   and revealed the Golden State’s Achilles heel.  By repealing ObamaCare                                                                                                                                                            and ending this massive subsidy   California’s budget will fail. California may be an exceptional state in many ways   but it will not be the “great exception” when it comes to basic budget math. To borrow the governor’s own words   you can’t make 2 times 2 equal anything but 4  —   not even in California. No wonder so many Americans are fleeing California for an “alternative reality”  —   one without Governor Jerry “Moonbeam” Brown. Tim Donnelly is a former California State Assemblyman.
